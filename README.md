# bope-wp
Website developed in WordPress that consumes API Rest from a separate admin panel. WordPress is used in the Front-End to improve the performance and CEO of the website. While the administrative panel was made in PHP, its function is to store information along with the database and provide this information through a REST API that I also developed.
